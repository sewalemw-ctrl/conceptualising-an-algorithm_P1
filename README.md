# A case of data cerealisation
We have used the provided template for the course [*Datalogical Thinking*](https://www.hb.se/globalassets/global/international-office/kursplaner-ischool/ht23_datalogical-thinking-c3mdt1.pdf)  

## About the Assignment
For this assignments, we will work together to curate a dataset, and use pseudocode to design an algorithm to process that dataset in a meaningful way. We have been asked to publish our dataset and algorithm on GitHub, alongside a simple website with some basic information on our project, dataset, and algorithm -- to be hosted using GitHub Pages. 

## About the Course
*Datalogical Thinking* is a course taught at the [University of Borås](https://www.hb.se) (Sweden), as part of the [MA in Information Science: Digital Environments](https://www.hb.se/en/international-student/program/programmes/masters-programme-in-information-science-digital-environments/). The course, in its current form, was designed by Wout Dillen, and taught for the first time in the autumn of 2023, with the help of his colleagues David Gunnarson Lorentzen, Kayvan Yousefi Mojir, Elisa Tattersall Wallin, and Anton Carlander Borgström.
